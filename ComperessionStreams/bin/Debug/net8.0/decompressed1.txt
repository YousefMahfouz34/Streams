Two general-purpose compression streams are provided in
the System.IO.Compression namespace: DeflateStream and
GZipStream. Both use a popular compression algorithm
similar to that of the ZIP format. They differ in that
GZipStream writes an additional protocol at the start and end
â€”including a CRC to detect errors. GZipStream also conforms
to a standard recognized by other software.
